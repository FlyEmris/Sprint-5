### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material? - Youtube, W3Schools, 

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software? - I would love to do more research to see what type of things are posible for my own adventure that I want to do.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)? Vscode, Youtube video. Github.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module. - Around 12ish mondays - friday. In the library or my own apartment.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan? - Biting off more than I can chew. Sometimes I want to do a great big thing but run out of time before I am able to accomplish my goals or tasks.


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.
